Introducing ZCLIP - my new Clipper VST written entirely in C++ with JUCE for maximum performance with upward compression, saturation, true peak protection, and up to 16x oversampling as well as parallel processing. This plugin combines classic hard clipping with a special upwards compression algorithm designed for maximising loudness without distortion. And best of all, it's completely FREE.
If you are not already using clipping as a part of your mastering chain, and you're looking to get really loud and crunchy masters - it is definitely something you should consider for taming peaks before going into your limiter, or even using the clipper as the final stage in your chain.
Aside from mastering, it can also be used as a creative effect or distortion with the saturation drive algorithm. Or use the upward compression algorithm in your master, or on drums or whatever for phatness. Sounds like a waste of time? Hear it in action right here on this video.
If you're on PC, you can grab V0.1 right now from my website and contribute feedback or feature requests for the next version, MacOS users - I will have a MaxOSX version out in November, The U.I. is also set to change, and the source code will be available on my Github for those who are also interested in modifying the plugin or just learning how
to code your own C++ VST plugins with the JUCE framework. Find out www.zerovst.com or on my github. (github.com/robertrumney)
